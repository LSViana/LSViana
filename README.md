I am a proud Web and Mobile Software Developer working and enjoying software development since 2013.

## My Journey up to This Day

Started in the development world because of games, I was curious and really intrigued by how everything worked under the hood. I started looking around in the Internet for resources on _how to create games_, then it turned into _how to code games_ and eventually became _how to code_! ðŸ˜‚

I got familiar with computers because my family had an _internet cafÃ©_ (known as _lan house_ in Brazil) and I literally spent _many_ days of my childhood behind a CRT monitor. I first learned how to create software using Java (reading _Deitel_ and its awesome books).

But when I got the _fundamentals_ and understood better the many choices I could take, I established my technology stacks:
- C# for back-end of web and mobile applications
- JavaScript (with React or Vue) for front-end of web applications
- Dart (with Flutter) for front-end of mobile applications
